# Flash Cards

## Overview of project and goals

### Overview
<p>This is an application that allows the user to go through a set of multiple
flashcards. The application will give the user to feed back based on if the
answer is incorrect/correct and move forward in the flashcards. To finish the user
must answer all of the flashcards correctly and if the user didn't get at least
90% of the questions correct on the first pass through the application will
restart</p>

## Challenges and Wins
